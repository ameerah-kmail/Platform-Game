# My platform game
## Goal
This game will have points to collect, blocks to jump on to and a door to end the level.There will be moving platforms that moves left to right and up and download in the game. We will get the player to travel with those platforms and make it into a nice and interactive little game using only windows forms and c# programming. All of the elements in the program are picture boxes so you can technically use your own images for the player, coins, door and platforms. So have fun with it and make it even better as your own game.

## Controls
Use arrows to run and space to jump.
